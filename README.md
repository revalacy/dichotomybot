# dichotomybot
An expansive bot for managing roleplaying mechanics in Discord.

Dichotomy requires discord.js and an unofficial Google Sheets API to allow simple database queries, using a workbook as the database.

Currently there are no concrete plans to expand Dichotomy to be instanced or hosted on multiple servers, but this may change in the future.
